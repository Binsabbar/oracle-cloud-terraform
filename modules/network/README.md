# Network
Probably one of the most important modules after [identity](../identity/README.md). Most of the objects created in Oracle Cloud must belong to a network in order to use it. This module configurs virtual cloud network. Read more about VCN concepts [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm). Have a look at `variables.tf` to check the list of required variables.

## What is created as part of the module?
The module will create a single virtual cloud network, with no subnet by default. You can pass a map of subnet configurations for public and private subnets.

When the VCN is created, the following objects are created by default:
* DHCP: Used by default for both public and private subnets
* Internet Gateway (defaultInternetGateway): it is attached to any created public subnet (configurable via variable `internet_gateway`)
* NAT Gateway (defaultNatGateway): It is attached to any created private subnet (configurable via variable `nat_gateway`)
* Route Table (defaultRouteTable): if no route table id is passed for a public subnet, this route table is used for the public subnet. The public default route table is configurable using `public_route_table_rules` variable.
* Private Route Table (defaultPrivateRouteTable): if no route table id is passed for a private subnet, this route table is used for the private subnet. The private default route table is configurable using `private_route_table_rules` variable.
* Default Public Security List: This list is attached to EVERY public subnet created.
* Default Private Security List: This list is attached to EVERY private subnet created.
* DNS Resolver: By default each VCN has DNS resolver once created and it has empty list of private views.
  
## Note About Default Security Lists:
* **Public security list**: By default empty, however, you can use `default_security_list_rules` variable to pass list of ports for ingress and egress traffic for tcp and udp to the world. Also you can enable icpm from and to the world as well.
* **Private security list**: By default empty, however, you can use `default_security_list_rules` variable to pass list of ports for ingress egress traffic for tcp and udp to the world. Also you can enable icpm from the VCN as well and to the world.
* It is possible to create another security list and pass its id to the subnet in `public_subnets` and `private_subnets` variables under key `security_list_ids`. The passed ids will be concatenated with the default list.

## Note about Route Table and Security List
* Route Table: the module will use default route table if not route table id is passed during creation of subnet. You can either configure the defaul route tables using `xxxxxx_route_table_rules` variables, or you can set different route table for each subnet you create using `route_table_id` key of the subnet you create.
* Security List: the module will create defaul subnet list rules, and you can enhance that further by creating your own security list and pass them as IDs to the subnet. You can also use `default_security_list_rules` to specify list of egress ports to the internet for the public and private subnets.

## Note about Gateways
* NAT Gateway is configurable via `nat_gateway` variable. When it is created, route rule to `0.0.0.0` is automatically added to `private_route_table` via the nat gateway. To disable creation of Nat Gateway, set `nat_gateway.enable` to `false`. Moreover, to enable creation, but block traffic, set `nat_gateway.block_traffic` to `true`.

* Internet Gateway can be disabled via `internet_gateway.enable` variable.

* Servie Gateway is configurable via `service_gateway` variable, and can be disabled as well. When it is created, route rule to "Services ID" is automatically added to `private_route_table` for the default route tabel of the private subnet. To add the route rule to the `public_route_table` for the default route table in public subnet, set the value `var.service_gateway.add_route_rule_in_public_subnet` to `true`.

* All gateways accept an optional parameter that attach a route table. Use one of the variables:
  * `internet_gateway.optionals.route_table_id`
  * `nat_gateway.optionals.route_table_id`
  * `service_gateway.optionals.route_table_id`

## Note About DNS Resolver:
* **DNS Resolver**: By default has no associated private views, you can enable attaching private views to DNS Resolver by passing the list of object of views, earlier views in the list have higher priority in resolution.

## Local Peering Gateway
***WARNING: you can't create two difference gateways then peer them at once. Changing the peering ID will destroy the gateway, then re-create it. So at least in the 2nd gateway you need the ID of the other getway***

To peer an instance with another, you will need to follow certain steps in order. Here are the steps:
1. Create a gateway using this module without supplying the peering id.
2. Get the OCID of the newly created Gateway.
3. In the other VCN's peering gateway, paste the OCID of the gateway.

## Note about IPv6
IPv6 is configurable via `ipv6` variable, and can be disabled as well. By default Oracle assigns a IPv6 /56 IP CIDR, to add your own CIDR the `ipv6.oci_allocation` variable can be set to false and the CIDR blocks can be set via `ipv6.cidr_blocks`.

Example:

VCN-A
```h
local_peering_gateway = {
  "peering-with-b" = {
    name              = "peeringWithB"
    peer_id           = null
    route_table_id    = ""
    destination_cidrs = []
  }
}
```
Assume that gives the ID: `ocid.peering.xxxxxxxA`

VCN-B
```h
local_peering_gateway = {
  "peering-with-a" = {
    name              = "peeringWithA"
    peer_id           = "ocid.peering.xxxxxxxA"
    route_table_id    = ""
    destination_cidrs = []
  }
}
```

# Example
VCN without any subnet:
```h
source = PATH_TO_MODULE

  compartment_id        = "ocixxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxx"
  name                  = "vcn-no-subnet"
  cidr_block            = "192.168.0.0/16"
  private_subnets       = {}
  public_subnets        = {}
```

VCN with two private subnets and one public subnet that has its own routing table, the VCN will also configure the DNS Resolver with list of attached Private Views objects, earlier views in the list have higher priority in resolution.
```h
module "network" {
  source = PATH_TO_MODULE

  compartment_id            = "ocixxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxx"
